# Introduction

A Simple Bill Tracker App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented login authorization so users can login and track their unique bills.

---

# Objectives

It's a bill tracking app created to understand MVC architecture and user authentication.

---

# Who is this for? 

Created to help anyone keep track of monthly bills and expenses. Carefully designed to be eye-catching and easy to use.

---

# How it's Made

express, mongoose,mongodb, bcrypt, passport, express-sessions, connect-mongo, express-flash, morgan, dotenv, ejs,  morgan, nodemon, passport-local, validator, and tailwind

---

# Optimizations

In the future, we would love to add the following additions:

- Add monthly routes so users can organize bills by month
- Add sorting, filtering, and search for bills

---

# Lessons Learned

- Coordination/Communication - We worked asynchronously to develop Billtrackr and assigned features to different contributers. It was a challenge making sure that there was not Github conflicts, so we all learned the importance of clear duties for each contributer.
- Meeting a deadline - Since all contributers had a deadline on this project, we had to decide which features were necessary for the MVP of the app. Some features have been put on hold, with the possibility of new features coming in the future.
